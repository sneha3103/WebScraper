## Overview
This is an app that uses Cheerio to scrape the Medium.com website and pull the most recent 20 articles. Whenever the user chooses, they can scrape the newest articles that have been added. Users can click on the images or the title to take them to the corresponding Medium article, or click the 'Save Article' button to save the article. Once an article is saved, the user has the option to add their own notes to the articles, or to remove them. Users can also type in their own little notes and save notes specific to the article. The user also has the option to delete notes that are no longer needed by clicking on the 'X. If the user decides they do not want the article on their list at all, the user has the option to delete that as well.
